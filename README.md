### How to play

The goal is to help Mary get from the grass to the nice blue swimming pool.
Use the arrow keys to help her cross.
Be careful she doen't touch any of
those nasty poisonous bugs as she crosses.
If that happens the game will end and a
short ascension service will take place.
If you collect any of the treasures that appear on the path
that will increase your score.
To restart the game after a collision with a bug, press <space>

## Thank you!
